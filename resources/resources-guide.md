# Resource Manager User Guide

## Overview
The Resource Manager is a web-based tool designed to help project managers track and manage tasks across different resources and projects.

## Interface Layout
The interface is divided into two main sections:
1. A resources panel on the left
2. A main content area on the right containing filters and a task table

## Resources Panel
Located on the left side of the screen, this panel displays all available resources.
- Click on any resource to view their assigned tasks
- The active resource will be highlighted in blue
- Resources are listed alphabetically for easy access

## Filtering and Viewing Tasks

### PM Filter Buttons
- Located at the top of the main content area
- Shows all Project Managers with active tasks
- Click a PM button to filter tasks for that specific Project Manager
- Your PM selection is saved between sessions
- Use "Clear PM" to remove the PM filter

### Additional Filters
